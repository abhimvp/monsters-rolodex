# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

### Learnings from the ZTM Course 

npm is a installable & also a executable environment & saves the info in a let's global location in our system.
npx basically install & executes the package/library & deletes it immediately on a high level perspective.


To create a react app >
`npx create-react-app monsters-roldex` -- we used npx to download the latest version of react app 
`cd monsters-rolodex`

`package.json` tells any developer what are the different packages or libraries this application needs in order to work.
* `react scripts` is a package helper that create-react-app gave us to develop our application , which help us in leveraging scripts `start` , `build` , `test` , `eject` to develop our application. 
* what does `start` do - It will take all the files that we have in our react application & it will run them in a local dev env., so that we can actually test it in browser. --> `yarn start`
* The entry point for every react project is `index.js` file. We leverage ReactDOM library to render our react app , render it finding some `document.getElementByID('root')` -> which is happening inside of `index.html` inside of `public` folder which is also generated by create-react-app for us.
* what does `build` do? - when we do build , react-scripts weill generate an optimal production build for us.It takes all of these css, js files & group it into one file related to css , js , index.html files & it will put it into a `build` folder - creates the most optimal low memeory version of our application as possible that an be sent fastest over the internet connection for a browser to consume.That's really all the build is doing for us.Also in the build process there's actually twoo packages - two helpers essentially one is `babel` & other is `webpack`. what babel does is takes this react code & condenses it down to js code that these browsers can understand.`webpack` is something that makes us code more efficient.breaks down the code into chunks we can find those in `build>static>js` folder & when a user trying to go to home page it can just pick up the homepage related code chunk.js file.Webpack is essentially modularizing our code.

`App.js` represents our entire react application.
React is pretty much using just `functions` to return `HTML`.We can see `function App()` as a `component`[self contained peice of code] { return (HTML)} 

when we are writing react , we're going to write either in class components or functional components with hooks.Functional components with hooks is the modern way that we do a lot of things with react , either way we're telling react when you want it to `render` or `re-render` different parts of your website. Focus on Understanding when react renders and re-render parts of your website,beacuase that's all react does as a framework.

Inside of jsx , react actually allows you to bind event handlers on to any HTML element. `eg: <button onClick={javascript code - expects a function/callbackFunction - () => {this.setState({name:'Hola Amigoo'})}}>` Event handlers is that i want to happen whenver an event happens. 
`read through app.js file comments to understand the usage of setState`

why react application as a SPA(Single Page Applications) makes it whole lot easier? ->
